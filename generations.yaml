Built at the Mazda Toyota Manufacturing USA plant in Huntsville, Alabama alongside the Toyota Corolla Cross, it shares its Skyactiv Small Product Group platform with the Mazda3 and CX-30 but features rugged styling designed for active outdoor lifestyles. The exterior features prominent black plastic cladding, squarer styling, and increased ground clearance compared to the CX-5. Powertrain options include a standard 2.5L Skyactiv-G naturally aspirated inline-four producing 187 hp and 186 lb-ft of torque, or a turbocharged 2.5L Skyactiv-G delivering 227-256 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque depending on fuel grade. A hybrid powertrain became available for the 2025 model year using Toyota's Hybrid System with a 2.5L A25A-FXS engine and eCVT transmission. All models feature standard i-Activ all-wheel drive with Mazda Intelligent Drive Select (Mi-Drive) modes. Trim levels include Select, Preferred, Premium, and Premium Plus, with a Meridian Edition offering all-terrain tires and outdoor-oriented accessories. The CX-50 received a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS."
