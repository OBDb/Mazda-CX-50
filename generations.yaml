    description: "The Mazda CX-50 represents Mazda's first purpose-built crossover designed specifically for the North American market with a focus on outdoor-oriented customers. Built at Mazda's joint-venture plant with Toyota in Alabama, it shares its platform architecture with the CX-30 and Mazda3 but with significant modifications for enhanced off-road capability. The exterior design features a bold interpretation of Mazda's KODO design language with more rugged elements including prominent black plastic cladding, a longer hood, and a wider stance than the CX-5. Despite similar dimensions to the CX-5, the CX-50 has a distinctly different character with its lower roof height, wider body, and more adventure-focused aesthetic. Powertrain options include a standard 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, or an available turbocharged 2.5L four-cylinder delivering up to 256 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque with premium fuel. Both engines pair with a six-speed automatic transmission and standard i-Activ all-wheel drive with enhanced off-road capability through Mazda Intelligent Drive Select (Mi-Drive) modes including specific off-road settings. The interior continues Mazda's upscale approach with high-quality materials and horizontal dashboard design, but incorporating more durable finishes and outdoor-oriented features like standard roof rails with higher load capacity than other Mazda crossovers. Technology includes a standard 8.8-inch or available 10.25-inch center display controlled by a rotary commander, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and comprehensive safety features through i-Activsense. The Meridian Edition adds exclusive all-terrain tires, specific 18-inch alloy wheels, and distinctive styling elements emphasizing the vehicle's outdoor capabilities. As Mazda's newest crossover, the CX-50 complements rather than replaces the CX-5 in Mazda's lineup, offering a more adventure-focused alternative with enhanced capability for light off-road use while maintaining Mazda's signature driving dynamics and premium feel."
